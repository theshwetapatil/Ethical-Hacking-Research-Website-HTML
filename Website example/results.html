    The valuable information I’ve received from Dr. Ertual’s interview goes as follows:
    </h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    There is a major difference between hacking ethical hacking. Hacking is carried out for some kind of personal benefit; may that be money, self-esteem or any other personal benefit. Ethical hacking, on the other hand is carried out without any personal gain.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Hiring a former hacker is good as far as the employee sticks to his job. If such an employee tries to blackmail the company for salary hike or any other such kind of demand, then definitely he/she is not a promising candidate for this position. The judgment for this probability can be done through HR interviews. But still as they can, you cannot judge a person based on the first impression.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Hacking is certainly not an advisable activity to do. People are curious about hacking and thus they try to follow hacking procedure and implement it. There are few organizations arranging hackethons, a way to hack into multiple systems. Some of them provide official courses to become a future ethical hacker. But, Dr. Ertual does not encourage becoming a hacker or ethical hacker. He also disagrees with the statement that few of the famous personalities today were once hackers.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Hacking is illegal in United States of America and there are certain laws and punishments against hacking. But practically speaking, it is extremely difficult to find out the real hacker and punish that real hacker. We are bounded by the technology in the process of finding real culprit. With the help of technology, we can easily figure out the hacking was carried out by which system, but cannot find out who did it. The hacker might have used other genuine person’s system or ip address of the system to carry out hacking. Hence, finding out the real culprit is too difficult.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Dr. Ertual clears out the confusing points regarding hackers’ excuses for carrying out hacking. Trespassing cannot be excluded from hacking terms, in fact such kinds of attacks have special name in the field of hacking. They are called passive attacks. Hacking is definitely not the only way to learn about systems. There are few other ways also available, if someone really wants to learn about a system. Hacking certainly helps in doing so. For example, after hacking into one system, we will design our system in such a way that, that kind of hacking cannot be carried out on our system.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Dr. Ertual does not personally recommend hacking job. Though it is ethical hacking, one gets direct access to the company systems. It is certainly, very huge responsibility. There are few institutions offering such ethical hacking courses, such that, after completing those courses, one can get a job as an ethical hacker.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    And the most important point of this interview, qualifications for a successful ethical hacker; apart from usual software skills and courses covered in ethical hacking courses, the most important quality one should have for being a successful ethical hacker is- being extremely patient. Dr. Ertual says this from his personal experience. Plus, after being an ethical hacker, one gets access to company’s confidential and important data. One should not take disadvantage of knowing this valuable information. In short, one must stick to their ethics in order to become a promising ethical hacker.

    That’s what ethical hacking is all about!!! Ethics!!!
