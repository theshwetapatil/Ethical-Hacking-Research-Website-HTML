    My personal opinion in this matter is in the favour of ethical hacking. If we consider, the recent cases, former hackers are proved to be really good industrial professionals. There was a time when hackers were considered to be unhealthy for industry hygiene. But now the time has changed, hackers are improved. Practically speaking, none of the software can be built 100% secure. There are always some or the other loopholes. New generation hackers are always ready to face new challenges. Hiring such hackers for industrial work would be good utilization of their energy. Plus, if they are under company conditions then they won’t be able to leak the company ideas/ company data publically. History of recent technological innovations proves that most of the industrials, who have reached the top positions now, were hackers in the beginning. Plus, only former hackers would be able to understand the line of thinking of any ordinary hacker. The way they say, in order to solve murder mystery, you need to think like a murderer.

    While committing ethical hacking, ethical hackers themselves are at the risk of legal laws and their consequences. In order to study and keep watch on criminal activity, they need to follow such criminal activity at their own risk. Most of the times, company doesn’t take risk of such criminal issues in order to maintain the business reputation. Though the intention of an ethical hacker is good, they are still under law enforcement. Each and every ethical hacker deicide and follow their own set of ethical guidelines to follow and implement while performing an ethical hacking task. The risk taken by such ethical hackers are really the matter of appreciation. Even after taking so many legal risks, they stick to their work and make sure it is accomplished. Their loyalty for work after being under the pressure of legal risks is something no ordinary employee could afford to do. In this era, of money minded people, these ethical hackers choose this job with pure intention to fulfill its requirements completely.
