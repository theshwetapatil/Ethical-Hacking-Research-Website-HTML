    <h2 style="color:brown">Hacking</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Hackin arises due to curiosity or money matters. A hacker hacks into a system being curious to about the system details. There are major amount of hackers in this world who do hacking for the exchange of money. Hacking is not an easy task. Only skilled programmer can perform hacking. Even all kinds of programmers are not able to hack into any system tactfully. And that is what rises the value of hacker.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Hackers are divided into two basic kinds:<br/><br/>
    Black Hat hackers <br/>
    And<br/>
    White Hat Hackers<br>
    </h2>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Black Hat Hackers:</h2>
    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    These are the kinds of hackers which perform hacking for the sake of money. These hackers carry out hacking in an illegal way. The intention of their hacking is break into any person or company’s system without their knowledge to gain access to the confidential data. After getting access to this secret data, they can either keep that data with them statically for future information or can modify that data. Both of these tasks are harmful to that particular person or company. Accessing someone’s personal/ professional information is definitely not a good practice to carry out.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">White Hat Hackers:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    These are the kinds of hackers which perform hacking for good purpose. They carry out hacking to check the company’s security. After such hacking is carried out, these hackers inform the company about their security system loopholes. The company modifies the system security as per their advice. And thus, these people use their hacking talent in a good direction. Hacking is their daily task. But they do it officially. Their hacking doesn’t harm any person or company. And hence, they are called white hat or good hackers.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Ethical hacker:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    The term ethical hacking came from these white hat hackers. White hat hackers are also known as ethical hackers. This name, as they perform the task of hacking ethically. Plus, these hackers do no harm to any company or person.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    According to techtarget.com, the definition of ethical hacker is as follows:</p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">An ethical hacker is a computer and networking expert who systematically attempts to penetrate a computer system or network on behalf of its owners for the purpose of finding security vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could potentially exploit.</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    They use their knowledge of penetrating methods and techniques to find the vulnerabilities in the system and to correct them. They do not take advantage or rather disadvantage of such vulnerabilities. Though they cannot secure the system completely, they make the system strong enough to handle automated attacks and attacked carried out by less experienced or less skilled hackers. The main task of ethical hackers is related to accounting and online transactions. They also take care of ATM machines, surveillance systems and other sales related devices.
    There are some institutions which provide official training for such ethical hackers. Before starting this training, each participant needs to sign a contract not to use this knowledge for bad intention or personal gain. CRESTS, Mile2, SANS institute, EC-Council are some of the organizations providing practical training for ethical hacking task. Ethical hacking is also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing and red teaming. In order to carry out ethical hacking, owner’s permission is must to crash the network. Without owner’s official permission, ethical hacking cannot b carried out. This may lead to legal problems. Hence, owner’s permission is and inevitable task while performing ethical hacking.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">History:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Ethical hacking came into picture during World War II. In 19th century, games like modern chess were used to officially hack the codes of opponents. The first official ethical hacks were conducted during this time to test the security of the Multics operating system. John Patrick, former IMB employee, first used the term “ethical hacking”, in the history of computing. And now, this term is spread all over the world, being used by almost every organization.
    This event also points out another fact, that is, hacking is not limited to computers. Hacking can carried out in any electronic system. In 1960, the hackers of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) hacked electronic trains. This was not a computer hack. This was electronic system hack. In 1970, phone hackers came into public. They used to hack telephonic systems. Caption Crunch aka John Draper created a blue box to make long distance calls. And based on this blue box invention two kids, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak decided to sell these blue boxes. These kids later became the founders of well established company Apple. In 1980, phone hacks or phreaks migrated to computers. They developed their first Bulletine Board System (BBS). These Bulletine Board Systems (BBS) were like today’s online conference groups. The official law against hacking was approved and published in 1986. 
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Before this, US government was unaware of the fact that hacking may lead to dangerous and disastrous outcomes. In modern world, there are various varieties and numbers of Viruses. Worms, Trojans. There are also different kinds of hackers and crackers. No data secure these days. No one is trustworthy. Person sitting next to us can hack into our system next day. In such an evil word, is has become must to become alert all the time. We should always keep an eye on our systems. And we should not trust and allow any person, whether that person is known or unknown, to give access to our personal private information, which will be useful to break into our systems. As they say, Prevention is always better than cure.
