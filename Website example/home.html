    Hacking is most of the times taken in negative terms. People always think hacking is the medium to break into the system in order to carry out some kind of criminal activity. But each coin has two sides. There is a special category of hackers called “ethical hackers” or “whitehats”. Hacking is their regular job to maintain the security of high profile company systems. I would like to cover ethical hacking related to social responsibility concept, which includes making company data secure, maintaining privacy of users, tracing criminal activities for security etc.

    My project concentrates on this positive aspect of hacking. Some of the big companies are hiring former hackers as ethical hackers now-a-days. There is big debate going on in IT world regarding this issue. Some are for some against the concept of “ethical hacking.” I would like to o ahead and try to solve the myths about ethical hacking and research on benefits of ethical hacking. “Ethical hacking” plays a vital role in maintaining the security of company data and that way preserving the privacy of company user/customer.

    Businesses and government-related organizations that are serious about their network security hire ethical hackers and penetration testers to help look into and develop their networks, applications, and other computer systems with the ultimate goal of preventing data theft and fraud. In order to become an ethical hacker, one needs certain software skills such as C, LISP, Perl, or Java and some database skills such a SQL. Plus, some certification courses are must in order to get into this career. Network+ or CCNA and Security+, CISSP, or TICSA are some of the certificates one needs to become an official ethical hacker. The post offered in companies for ethical hacker is called Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). Apart from technical skills, an ethical hacker should be smart, quick grasper and should have interpersonal skills. Social engineering is a must for an ethical hacker. Apart from these, an ethical hacker must be aware of legal issues of hacking. There are some institutions which officially offer courses to become an ethical hacker. Before starting these courses, one must sign the legal contract not to use their knowledge of course for personal gain or unethical purpose.
