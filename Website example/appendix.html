    <h2 style="color:brown">
    As a part of activity for this project, I interviewed Dr. Levent Ertual in-person. Dr. Levent Ertual is the professor in Computer Science department. But, the amount of knowledge he has on the subject of security and ethical hacking is unbeatable. Thus, I felt he was the right person to interview in this area of subject.
    </h2>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Interview questions:</h2>

    <h3 style="color:brown">What is your opinion on hiring former hackers as ethical hackers in the companies? And what makes you think like that?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    It is good as long as ethical hacker stick to his job. There has been the cases I know, whether ethical hackers went beyond their job and started blackmailing the companies for more money or any other benefit. So, it is good as well as bad.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">Do you believe that hacking is different from ethical hacking? Why?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Yes. I believe so. In ethical hacking you are not making any damage to anyone. But in hacking you are damaging the private information.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">History has proved that most of the top industrials today were hackers in their young age. Would you encourage hackers to perform hacking? Why so?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Personally, I don’t believe that top industrials were hackers once. And hacking is the crime in United States, so if you are hacking into a system, you will get punished.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">These days even immature youngsters are carrying out hacking. Do you think hacking will affect on youngers’ mindset? Explain in detail.</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    As I said earlier, hacking is still a crime. But, people get curious about hacking. The positive aspect of hacking is once you hack into a system, you will remember those loopholes in the system and will make sure that you won’t be able to crack into your own system and thus will design the system accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">Such young hackers should be punished for hacking or should be encourages for their talent?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    I do not encourage hacking. Hacking is illegal in United States and there are rules made to punish such hackers.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">What according to you is the ideal punishment for young hackers?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    I am not a judge to decide punishment for them. There are laws made to punish such hackers. But these laws are not enough to punish each and every hacker. For example, if the hacker is hacking the system from different country, then we won’t be able to punish him according to US laws. Most of the countries don’t have laws against such crimes.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">Do you believe giving right direction to such young hackers would be ideal or this will encourage young hackers to perform even more dangerous hacks? Explain.</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    As I said earlier, I do not encourage hacking. Hacking is illegal in United States. There are some official hacking competitions are carried out in United States to perform hacking. So that, one can check the vulnerability of the system.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">Some people think, trespassing is like some stranger entering into someone’s house, without the intention of making any damage to the house. Their sole purpose is to look around and get the idea of the architecture. The same happens while breaking into the system with similar kind of intention. Do you think trespassing should be considered as ethical hacking? Why?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    We call that passive attack. I don’t it is ethical. Even if you are not altering the data, you are still breaking into the system without permission. And thus, it is hacking, not ethical one.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">Hackers believe that breaking into a computer is the only way to learn about computers or to learn about system security. Do you agree with this statement? Why?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    I don’t believe so. To check the system, you need to open and close ports. Hacking cannot be the only solution to learn the systems. But yes, hacking helps in building a better system. For example, if you have already hacked into one system and know the vulnerabilities of that system, you will keep those points in mind while designing your own system and will design the system accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">What kinds of risks ethical hackers face? Are these risks worth for this job? Would you inspire us to choose ethical hacker as a profession? What are the risks involved in this job financially and personally? </h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    I do not encourage you to become a hacker or choose this field as your professor. Hacking is illegal in United States. Though this kind of job is legal, company you gives direct access to the confidential data. You need make sure to keep it secured and do not take disadvantage of your knowledge or position.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:brown">For kinds of qualities one should have to become a successful ethical hacker?</h3>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    You need usual software skills. There are some institutions offering courses to become legal hacker. In my personal experience, you need to be really patient to become an ethical hacker.
