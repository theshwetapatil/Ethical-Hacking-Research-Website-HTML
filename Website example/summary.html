    Here is the video of ethical hacker Cal Leeming talking about his experience in this field. An ethical hacker himself would be the best person to give conclusion on this topic.

    My research topic is related to the Chapter 5 of Crime lecture. While reading this topic, I realized that we covered different aspects of hackers and other crimes related to computing and social responsibility. But somehow, the importance ethical hackers remained untouched or hardly touched. Thus I decided to stress on this point.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    For this purpose I decided to take help of Dr.Levent Ertual, since he is the expert in the field of computer security. I prepared few interview questions for him and interviewed him. The results of this interview are provided in results as well as appendix tabs.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    For doing research on this topic, I went through various articles related to ethical hacking as well as hacking. I read all these articles thoroughly to understand the concept of both hacking and ethical hacking. Experts have conflicts regarding the issue of ethical hacking. These conflicts are yet to be solved. Logically speaking there is no black or white in this matter. Though experts have divided hackers into black hat and white hat category, the opinion of hackers and thus experts varies from case to case.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Hackers are basically divided into three types- Black Hat Hackers, White Hat Hackers and Grey Hat Hackers. Black Hat Hackers perform hacking for bad intention. White Hat Hackers perform hacking for good intention and Grey Hat Hackers lie in-between Black Hat Hackers and White Hat Hackers. Most ideal hackers to hire will be White Hat Hackers. But there are also the benefits of hiring Grey Hat Hackers. There are risks involved in hiring such kinds of hackers.
    </p>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Ethical hacking is still not good profession to get into, according to Dr. Ertual. Though ethical it is still hacking, you gain direct access to the company’s systems. While entering in this professor, one skill you must have is a lot of patience. There are several institutes offering these courses to become an official certified ethical hacker. But hacking is illegal in United States, though is it curious to hack, you might get arrested for performing this task. Laws enforced against hacking are not enough to find out and punish each and every hacker. If someone breaks into your system and uses your IP address to break to another official system, then we can hardly figure out who actually did it. Hence, hacking and even ethical  hacking is risk taking task to perform.
