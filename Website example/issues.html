    Ethical hacking is still the subject of conflict. There are various opinions expressed on this topic by experts.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
      <h2 style="color:brown">The main two kinds of opinions are: for and against ethical hacking.</h2>
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Against ethical hacking:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    Most of the people having opinion against ethical hacking are usually of traditional thinking process. According to them, a hacker is a hacker, no matter what. Whatever he does after that, is not going to change him from a traditional hacker to ethical hacker.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">In favour of ethical hacking:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    There are some experts who agree with the opinion that former hackers could be beneficial to the companies. If such hackers are hired for the company, then the company’s security system will be more powerful. These hackers would be able to crack the normal way of hacker’s thinking and thus company systems could be protected in time.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:brown">Opinion against hacking:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    These people think, the only crime committed by any hacker is the crime of getting curious about breaking into the systems. No matter what, hacker is still a hacker, a criminal who tries to steal the information from someone’s personal or professional system.  According to them, access to the computer system can give you the real idea of how things get carried out in actual world. As far as ethics are concerned, they vary from person to person. Breaking into the systems, just to gain knowledge without leaking any personal or confidential information of that system is still ethical hacking, according to some people. And ethical hacker has complete liberty to share the knowledge of hacking he has. A hackers coding structure should be made publically available to give them their right. These people have objection on law considering trespassing as unethical hacking. According to them, breaking into a system, just to look around and get the idea of the system architecture does no harm to the company or any person. And hence, trespassing could be considered as ethical hacking. Hackers believe that breaking into a computer is the only way to learn about computers or to learn about system security. Plus, hacking into any software gives better idea of that software before buying. Otherwise, any company could take disadvantage of customer’s lack of knowledge and would sell the products for more cost, claiming to have more features than it actually has. Plus, the companies can buy the faulty products having partial features than the claimed ones. If the companies decide to be loyal and frank to the customers and they can succeed in explaining the people that stealing information from systems is as serious crime as stealing some physical belonging, then they might be able to understand the seriousness and consequences of hacking or information stealing. It is each and every company’s responsibility to make people aware of hacking and explain them the difference between hacking and ethical hacking.

    <h2 style="color:brown">Opinion in favour of ethical hacking:</h2>

    <p style="color:darkgoldenrod; font-size:20">
    The reason for ethical hacking is basically, some unethical hacker breaks into the system, without our knowledge, without letting us know the consequences of that hacking. In ethical hacking, we carry out the hacking on our own system, with our complete knowledge. So that, we can find out the vulnerabilities in our system and make changes accordingly, to make our system even more secure. According to some people, ethical hackers provide unbeatable service to the society. When ethical hackers agree for such contract they sign, they are quite aware of the legal issues they will face in case they break the rules. They completely understand the requirements of their employer and thus will not go beyond their limits. The only mistake they can make is publically announcing the systems vulnerabilities of company system during any public conference of company, and that too without the permission of the employer. Such kind of behavior could certainly not be acceptable in any sort of company. And hence, any ethical hacker must make sure that for any company, he/she should not reveal that company’s system vulnerabilities during any company conference, or even  after leaving the company, to any other company they will work for.
